"Pokemon Multiplayer Red"

This is an attempt at cloning Pokemon Red and Blue but with one small change: it's multiplayer. You and your buddy will be able to team up and tackle the original game as it was on your original Gameboy (Color too when SGB palette support gets added), so it isn't like a MMORPG where you play a poorly-made blend of different generations with a million strangers you don't know.

The original goal of this will be to remake the engine and then add multiplayer. This engine currently uses data dumps from pokered and what I've (Lin) dumped myself with ClassicMap. To help improve accuracy and aid with alignment and animations, all graphics are drawn using 8x8 tiles, as they were in the original game. This also makes dumps easier to work with, since the only manual data needed is the formation data.

Currently this is a solo project, and the dumped resources aren't in this repository to avoid copyright issues. If you're interested in the project you'll just have to wait until demos get released. :)
